## Notes:
> &emsp;&emsp;今天早上一直在写 外包检查工具 以及 TSM镜像工具 的文档，这个过程花费了我大量的时间，（整整一个个早上，我原本还预计只需要半个小时就可以完成的说(*/ω＼*)）
> &emsp;&emsp;中午状态不是特别好，特别是中途有打瞌睡的情况，或许主要的原因还是在于Python API 的巨大的坑吧。
> &emsp;&emsp;今天下午总算是摸索出了 Maya Python API 中的allIntersections 的全部功能，总算不再是盲人摸象了。
> &emsp;&emsp;主要还是参考了 jlCollisonDeformer 的写法，但是由于参数太多之前一直没有弄明白这个函数的具体操作是怎样的，返回的是什么东西。
> &emsp;&emsp;今天测试了之后发现
> raySource	MFloatPoint	Ray starting point.
rayDirection	MFloatVector	Direction of the ray.
space	MSpace constant	Coordinate space in which the raySource, rayDirection and the returned hitPoint are specified.
maxParam	float	Specifies the maximum radius within which hits will be considered. This radius is specified as a multiple of the length of the rayDirection vector, so any hits beyond raySource+maxParam*rayDirection will not be considered. This value must be positive.
testBothDirections	bool	Specifies that hits in the negative rayDirection should also be considered. The maxParam value still applies to limit the search radius, which means that if testBothDirections is true, then only hits that lie between raySource-maxParam*rayDirection and raySource+maxParam*rayDirection will be considered.
faceIds	sequence of ints	If present, restricts the search to the specified faces.
triIds	sequence of ints	Face-relative triangle IDs. If present, faceIds must also be present and the two form (face, triangle) pairs to which the search is restricted.
idsSorted	bool	Set this to True if the faceIds or faceIds/triIds arrays are properly sorted into ascending order. For face-triangle pairs, the arrays must be sorted by ascending face ids, then by ascending triangle ids within each face. The routine sortIntersectionFaceTriIds() can be used to perform this task. It is not important to sort ids unless an acceleration structure is being used. When using an acceleration structure in conjunction with a limited set of faces or face-triangles, it is ESSENTIAL to sort the indices, otherwise performance will be severely degraded.
accelParams	MMeshIsectAccelParams	Optional parameters for accelerating the search.
tolerance	float	Numerical tolerance for the intersection operation. For numerical reasons, it is wise to allow the intersection routine to consider hits that lie a tiny bit outside mesh triangles. This parameter defines how close a ray has to be to hitting a triangle in order for a hit to register. Obviously, hits within the triangle are always considered, but we also consider hits that are up to a distance of tol*edgeLength away from the triangle, where "edgeLength" is the length of the edge of the triangle that is closest to the ray. This tolerance value is also used to collapse multiple nearly-identical hits that may arise due to numerical imprecision when a ray passes extremely close to a mesh vertex. Any two hits that are less than tol multiplied by the length of rayDirection apart will be considered the same hit, and treated interchangeably.
sortHits	bool	If True, then hits will be sorted in ascending ray-parametric order, so hits behind the raySource will be first (if testBothDirections is true), moving proceeding closer to the raySource, followed by hits in front of the raySource, proceeding by increasing distance from the raySource. If False, hits will be presented in no particular order in the returned arrays.
